        Julia and Kate are still studying dogs, and this time they are studying
        if dogs are eating too much or too little. Eating too much means the
        dog's current food portion is within a range 10% above and 10% below the
        recommended portion (see hint).
        <br />
        <br />
        1.Loop over the array containing dog objects, and for each dog,
        calculate the recommended food portion and add it to the object as a new
        property. Do NOT create a new array, simply loop over the array.
        Formula: recommended = weight ** 0.75 * 28. (The result is in grams of
        food, and the weight needs to be in kg)
        <br />
        <br />
        2.Find Sarah's dog and log to the console whether it's eating too much
        or too little. HINT: Some dogs have multiple owners, so you first need
        to find Sarah in the owners array, and so this one is a bit tricky (on
        purpose)
        <br />
        <br />
        3.Create an array containing all owners of dogs who eat too much
        ('ownersEatTooMuch') and an array with all owners of dogs who eat too
        little
        <br />
        <br />
        4.Log a string to the console for each array created in 3., like this:
        "Matilda and Alice and Bob's dogs eat too much!" and "Sarah and John and
        Micheal's dogs eat too little!"
        <br />
        <br />
        5.Log to the console whether there is any dog eating EXACTLY the amount
        of food that is recommended (just true or false)
        <br />
        <br />
        6.Log to the console whether there is any dog eating an OKAY amount of
        food (just true or false)
        <br />
        <br />
        7.Create an array containing the dogs that are eating an OKAY amount of
        food (try to reuse the condition used in 6.)
        <br />
        <br />
        8.Create a shallow copy of the dogs array and sort it by recommended
        food portion in an ascending order (keep in mind that the partions
        inside the array's object)
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Hint 1: Use many different tools to solve these challenges, you can use
        the summary lecture to choose between them.
        <br />
        <br />
        Hint 2: Being within a range 10% above and below the recommended portion
        means: current > (recommended * 0.9) && current < (recommended * 1.1).
        Basically, the current portion should be between 90% and 110% of the
        recommended portion.
        <br />

        TEST DATA:
        <br />
        const dogs = [ { weight: 22, curFood: 250, owners: ['Alice','Bob']}, {
        weight: 8, curFood: 200, owners: ['Matilda'] }, { weight: 13, curFood:
        275, owners: ['Sarah','John'] }, { weight: 32, curFood: 340, owners:
        ['Micheal'] } ]
