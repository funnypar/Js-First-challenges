Julia and Kate are doing a study on dogs. So each of them asked 5 dog
owners about their dog's age, and stored the data into an array (one
array for each). For now, they are just interested in knowing whether a
dog is an adult or a puppy. A dog is an adult if it is at least 3 years
old, and it's a puppy if it's less than 3 years old.

The idea of this project come from Jonas Schmedtmann JS courses *****

But i did it by myself ;)
